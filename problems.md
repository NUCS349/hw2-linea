## Problems

## Code implementation (5 points)
Pass test cases by implementing the functions in the `code` directory.

Your grade for this section is defined by the autograder. If it says you got an 80/100,
you get 4 points here.

## Free response questions (5 points)

Answer the following free response questions in a separate document, 
saved as a .pdf and **uploaded to Canvas**.

#### 1. (0.5 point) Use the function you implemented `generate_regression_data` to generate 100 points of data (`amount_of_noise` = 0.1) from a polynomial function of degree 4. Randomly select 10 points as your training data. The rest will be your testing data.  Run your implementation of `PolynomialRegression` 10 times, starting with degree one and increasing the degree of the polynomial each time, until you reach degree 10. Now create the following graphs.
   - A. (0.25 points) A graph that shows mean squared error of your regression on the data as a function of degree. Make the horizontal dimension be degree of the polynomial used to fit the data. Make the vertical dimension the sum of squared residual error. Label your axes. Put two lines on this plot, one that shows TRAINING error as a function of polynomial degree, and one that shows TESTING error as a function of polynomial degree. Make sure to label which is testing and which is training error. 
   - B. (0.25 points) Create a 2nd plot that shows a scatterplot of your training data. Overlay this scatterplot with plots of the following 3 polynomial curves. Be sure to label each curve with its degree. 
      - The polynomial with lowest testing error
      - The polynomial with lowest training error
      - The polynomial with degree 4. 

#### 2. (0.5 point) Repeat exactly what you did in question 1, but this time, use 50 data points as your training data.

#### 3. (0.5 points) Given your plots from question 1 and 2, describe the relationship of the error to the degree of poynomial used to generate the data originally and the degree of polynomial used to fit the data. How does this change as the number of data points change?

#### 4. (0.5 points) Given your plots from the previous questions is it a good idea to fit the data with the highest degree polynomial available? Why or why not? I suggest phrasing your answer in terms of underfitting and overfitting.

#### 5. (0.5 points) Explain how to do linear classification via linear regression. Be clear. Use a graph to illustrate how it works. This graph doesn't need to be generated by your code, but it must be clearly labeled and made by you (not cut and pasted from somewhere). Explain one key weakness of classification via regression. Be clear. Perhaps illustrate this point, as well, with a graph.

#### 6.(0.5 point) In the data directory, we provide 5 datasets as json files: blobs, circles, crossing, parallell_lines and transform_me. For each of these 5 provided datasets (mentioned above), generate a scatter plot of the data with your own code. Color each point according to its true class. Plot the linear separator learned by your perceptron on top of the scatter plot, for each data set. If the perceptron never converged on a final line, pick the line it had generated by the time it reached max_iterations. See the source for`load_json_data` for an example of how to plot a scatterplot. Using http://https://matplotlib.org is encouraged.  

(Aside: you can upload the json files containing the datasets to http://ml-playground.com/ to see how different learning algorithms work on each dataset. This is not required for points, and you're definitely not allowed to submit scatter plots built by ml-playground, but it might be illuminating and useful for checking your work).

#### 7. (1 point) For each of the 5 datasets (0.2 points per data set), say whether your perceptron successfuly separated the two classes on this dataset. Explain why or why not. 

#### 8. (0.5 points) In `code/perceptron.py`, you passed a test case by implementing the function `transform_data`. Describe the transformation you made to the input data to pass the test case. Explain how it allowed you to pass the test case (i.e. how did the change made to the data enable the system to do what it could not previously do?).
